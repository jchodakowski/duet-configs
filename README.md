# Jason C's Duet Configs

These configuration files are for my various 3D printers that are supported by Duet3D hardware. Those configurations are here. I _strongly_ suggest you don't use them because my configurations may be terrible. I present them here for others to view and hopefully tell me where I'm going wrong and not the other way around.

I am not an expert. Use at your own risk.
